*This was a group semester-long project that received a grade of 96% from UVA CS3240 - Advanced Software Development*

**Next Steps**
* There is currently no option to delete a request. Users can only "hide" the study group which isn't ideal. 
* GroupMe is not ideal! The access tokens change frequently with no warning and both user and community support are bare bones. Using a different tool like zoom, google meets, or perhaps an email account to email each member of the study group so that they can make their own communication decisions 
* Overall improvements such as code optimization, removing uneeded imports, fixing documentation/comments, refining UI/UX, and significantly improving testing coverage

Study Buddy App

Welcome to our Study Buddy app!

Once you login with an existing Google account, you can go ahead and edit your profile! Add a profile picture, major, year, description - anything to help other potential study buddies get to know you better!

Once you finish editing your profile, you can begin to add the classes you're currently taking. Take a look at the Courses tab if you need a reminder.  

You can look at "Open Requests" to see if there are any open study groups available suited for you and if not, you can create a StudyBuddy request and specify what it's for and how big you want the group to be!
